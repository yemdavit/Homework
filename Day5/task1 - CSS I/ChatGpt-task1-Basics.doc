Definition of CSS:
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. It controls how elements are displayed on the web page, such as layout, colors, fonts, and spacing. CSS separates the content (HTML) from the presentation, making it easier to maintain and style web pages consistently.

Role of CSS in Web Development:
Design and Layout: CSS helps in designing the look and feel of a website by controlling the layout, positioning, and styling of elements.
Responsive Design: CSS allows developers to create websites that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
Consistency: By using external stylesheets, CSS ensures a uniform design across multiple pages of a website.
Flexibility and Control: CSS gives developers control over how HTML elements are displayed, enabling complex visual designs.
HTML Document with a Basic CSS Stylesheet:
html
Copy code


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Basic CSS Example</title>
    <style>
        /* CSS styles */
        body {
            background-color: lightblue; /* Changes the background color of the page */
            color: white; /* Changes the text color to white */
            font-size: 20px; /* Sets the default font size for the text to 20 pixels */
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
    <p>This is a simple HTML document with CSS applied.</p>
</body>
</html>




Explanation of the CSS Code:
<style> tag: This tag is used to define CSS rules inside the HTML document. It should be placed inside the <head> section.

CSS Selector - body: The body selector applies styles to the entire page, affecting all the content inside the <body> tag.

background-color: lightblue;: This changes the background color of the page to light blue.
color: white;: This sets the text color of all elements inside the <body> tag to white.
font-size: 20px;: This sets the default font size for all the text on the page to 20 pixels.
Effect on HTML Elements:
The <body> tag styles the entire webpage, meaning every element inside it (like the heading <h1> and paragraph <p>) will have a light blue background, white text color, and a font size of 20px.
This basic example shows how CSS can be used to change the appearance of an HTML page. By adjusting the values of CSS properties, you can further customize the design.
