The CSS Box Model
The CSS box model represents each element on a web page as a box. This box consists of four main components:

Content: The area that contains the actual content of the element (text, images, etc.).
Padding: The space between the content and the border.
Border: The outline of the element.
Margin: The space outside the border, separating the element from other elements.
The total width or height of an element is calculated as follows:

width/height = content + padding + border + margin
Example HTML Layout:

HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Box Model Example</title>
  <style>
    .box {
      border: 2px solid black;
      padding: 10px;
      margin: 20px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="box">
    This is some content.
  </div>
</body>
</html>
Use code with caution.

Visual Examples:

Changing Padding:

Increasing padding:

CSS
.box {
  padding: 20px;
}
Use code with caution.

This will increase the space between the content and the border, making the element larger.

Decreasing padding:

CSS
.box {
  padding: 5px;
}
Use code with caution.

This will decrease the space between the content and the border, making the element smaller.

Changing Margin:

Increasing margin:

CSS
.box {
  margin: 40px;
}
Use code with caution.

This will increase the space between the element and other elements, creating more distance.

Decreasing margin:

CSS
.box {
  margin: 0;
}
Use code with caution.

This will remove the space between the element and other elements, causing them to touch.

Changing Border:

Increasing border width:

CSS
.box {
  border: 4px solid black;
}
Use code with caution.

This will make the border thicker.

Changing border color:

CSS
.box {
  border: 2px solid blue;
}
