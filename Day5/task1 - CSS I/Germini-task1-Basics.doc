CSS is a programming language used to style HTML elements on the web. It allows you to control the appearance of your webpage, including:

Layout: How elements are arranged on the page.
Colors: The background and text colors.
Fonts: The fonts and font sizes used.
Spacing: Margins, padding, and borders.
Effects: Animations, transitions, and transformations.
Role in Web Development:

CSS is essential for creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites. It separates the content (HTML) from the presentation (CSS), making it easier to maintain and update your website. By using CSS, you can create consistent styles across multiple pages and devices, ensuring a cohesive user experience.
