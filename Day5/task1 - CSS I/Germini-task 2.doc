Inline CSS

Definition: CSS rules are directly applied to individual HTML elements using the style attribute.
Syntax:
HTML
<element style="property: value; property: value;">...</element>
Use code with caution.

Example:
HTML
<h1 style="color: blue; font-size: 36px;">This is a heading</h1>
Use code with caution.

Advantages:
Provides granular control over specific elements.
Can be useful for quick styling adjustments.
Disadvantages:
Makes HTML code less readable and maintainable.
Difficult to reuse styles across multiple elements.
Not suitable for large-scale projects.
Internal CSS

Definition: CSS rules are defined within the <head> section of an HTML document using the <style> tag.
Syntax:
HTML
<head>
  <style>
    /* CSS rules */
  </style>
</head>
Use code with caution.

Example:
HTML
<head>
  <style>
    h1 {
      color: red;
      font-size: 24px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>This is a heading</h1>
</body>
Use code with caution.

Advantages:
Improves code organization and readability.
Allows for styling multiple elements within the same document.
Suitable for smaller projects.
Disadvantages:
Not ideal for large-scale projects with complex styling requirements.
Styles cannot be reused across multiple HTML documents.
External CSS

Definition: CSS rules are defined in a separate file with a .css extension and linked to the HTML document using the <link> tag.
Syntax:
HTML
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
Use code with caution.

Example: styles.css
CSS
h1 {
  color: green;
  font-size: 18px;
}
Use code with caution.

index.html
HTML
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <h1>This is a heading</h1>
</body>
Use code with caution.

Advantages:
Separates content from presentation, improving code organization and maintainability.
Allows for easy reuse of styles across multiple HTML documents.
Ideal for large-scale projects with complex styling requirements.
Disadvantages:
Requires additional HTTP requests to load the CSS file, potentially impacting page load speed.
