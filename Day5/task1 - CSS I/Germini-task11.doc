Tables
Traditional purpose: Tables were originally designed for presenting tabular data, such as spreadsheets or databases.
Layout usage: While tables can be used for layout, it's generally not recommended due to their semantic meaning.
CSS styling: Tables can be styled using CSS properties like border, padding, margin, width, and height.
<div> Elements
Purpose: <div> elements are generic container elements that can be used to group other elements together.
Layout usage: <div> elements are commonly used for layout, especially when combined with CSS properties like display, float, flex, and grid.
CSS styling: <div> elements can be styled using various CSS properties, including those used for tables.
When to Use Tables vs. <div> Elements

Use tables for tabular data: If you're presenting data in a structured format with rows and columns, tables are the appropriate choice.
Use <div> elements for layout: For general layout purposes, such as creating columns or sections, <div> elements are more flexible and semantically correct.
Example HTML Document:

HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Tables vs. Divs</title>
  <style>
    table {
      border-collapse: collapse;
    }

    td, th {
      border: 1px solid black;
      padding: 8px;
    }

    .container {
      display: flex;
      justify-content: space-between;
    }

    .column {
      width: 300px;
      border: 1px solid black;
      padding: 10px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
