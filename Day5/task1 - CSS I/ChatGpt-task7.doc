Online Fonts and How to Use Them
Online fonts are web-based fonts that can be accessed from an external server rather than relying on fonts installed locally on a user's computer. One of the most popular services providing online fonts is Google Fonts, which offers a wide selection of free fonts that can be easily integrated into websites.

Benefits of Online Fonts:
Consistency: Ensures that all users see the same font, regardless of their local font installations.
Variety: Offers a large selection of custom fonts, enabling more design flexibility.
Performance: Hosted by reliable servers that optimize font loading.
How to Use Google Fonts in an HTML Document
Choose a Font from Google Fonts:

Visit the Google Fonts website and select a font you want to use.
Copy the <link> tag provided by Google for the chosen font.
Add the Font to Your HTML File:

Paste the <link> tag into the <head> section of your HTML document.
In your CSS, apply the font to elements using the font-family property.
Example of Using Google Fonts:
html
Copy code



<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Google Fonts Example</title>
  <!-- Link to Google Fonts -->
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
  <style>
    body {
      font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
    }
    h1 {
      font-weight: 700;
    }
    p {
      font-weight: 400;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>

  <h1>Using Google Fonts</h1>
  <p>This paragraph is using the Roboto font from Google Fonts with a normal font-weight.</p>

</body>
</html>



In the example:

The <link> tag imports the Roboto font from Google Fonts.
The CSS applies the Roboto font to the body and sets different font weights (400 for normal and 700 for bold).
What is a Favicon?
A favicon (short for "favorite icon") is a small icon that appears in the browser tab, next to the websiteâ€™s title. It also shows up in bookmark lists, browser history, and in some cases, address bars. Adding a favicon enhances the branding of your website and makes it easily recognizable.

How to Add a Favicon to a Web Page:
Prepare the Favicon Image:

Favicons are typically 16x16 or 32x32 pixels in size and saved in .ico, .png, or .svg formats.
Add the Favicon to Your HTML File:

Place the favicon image in your project folder.
Add a <link> tag to the <head> section of your HTML document to link the favicon.
Example of Adding a Favicon:
html
Copy code



<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Favicon Example</title>
  <!-- Link to Favicon -->
  <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
</head>
<body>

  <h1>Favicon Example</h1>
  <p>This page has a custom favicon that appears in the browser tab.</p>

</body>
</html>



In this example:

The <link> tag links to a favicon.ico file, which is the favicon for the webpage.
Conclusion
Online fonts like those from Google Fonts offer flexibility and consistency in font usage across different devices and browsers. You can easily integrate them into your site using a <link> tag and apply them via CSS.

A favicon is a small but important visual element that helps with website branding. You can add it by linking a small image file in the <head> of your HTML document.
