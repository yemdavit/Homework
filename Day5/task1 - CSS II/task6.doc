Explanation of the Card Component:
Nesting with BEM (Block, Element, Modifier): The card uses BEM-style naming (card, card__image, card__title) to organize the styles in a clear, modular way. Each sub-element (e.g., __image, __title, __description, __button) belongs to the card block, ensuring that these styles are encapsulated and won't interfere with other elements on the page.

Variables: The $primary-color and $font-stack variables are used to maintain consistent colors and typography across the component. Changing these variables will globally update the styles.

Modifiers and Pseudo-Classes:

The &:hover pseudo-class adds an animation effect when the user hovers over the card, slightly scaling it up.
The button’s hover effect uses the darken() function to adjust the button color on hover.
Reusability: This component can be reused multiple times by simply copying the HTML structure and ensuring the styles are applied via the .card class. The styles remain consistent, and the card will automatically adapt to different content.

Structuring Components in a Sass Project
To maintain an organized Sass project, components are often modularized into separate partial files and then imported into a central stylesheet.

Typical Sass Project Structure:
arduino
Copy code
/sass
  |_ /components
      |_ _card.scss       // Card component styles
      |_ _navbar.scss     // Navbar component styles
      |_ _footer.scss     // Footer component styles
  |_ _variables.scss      // Global variables
  |_ styles.scss          // Main stylesheet
In this structure:

Variables are defined in a global _variables.scss file and can be accessed by all components.
Components like the card, navbar, and footer have their own Sass partials under the /components directory.
The main styles.scss file imports the variables and all the component partials to compile into one main CSS file.
Benefits of Structuring Components in a Sass Project:
Separation of Concerns: Each component has its own file, making it easier to manage, update, and scale as the project grows.
Reusability: Components are self-contained and can be easily reused or modified for different parts of the project.
Consistency: Variables ensure that styles like colors, font sizes, and spacing remain consistent across all components.
Maintainability: When updates are needed, changes can be made in one component file, and the rest of the project will automatically inherit those changes.
Summary
CSS Components allow for the modular, reusable, and maintainable encapsulation of UI elements.
Sass enhances components by supporting features like variables, functions, and nesting, making it easier to build and maintain scalable UI elements.
The card component created here demonstrates how to structure a component using Sass, and how Sass’s features like variables and nesting simplify style management.
Structuring components in a Sass project ensures maintainability, reusability, and clean organization for larger, scalable projects.
